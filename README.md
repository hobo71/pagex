### FAQ
##### Is it compatible with my theme?
The short answer is yes. But technically speaking theme should not interfere with the website in any way. To avoid issues with styles it must not unique any styles or add custom functions which affecting default WordPress behavior. The ideal theme for Pagex will be completely empty functions.php and no CSS or JS presented.
##### What plugins for custom content types are supported?
Currently only Pods Plugin is supported but work in progress.
